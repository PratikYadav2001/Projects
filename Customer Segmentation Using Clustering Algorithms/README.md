# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms!

This project aims to segment customers using K-means clustering algorithm based on the Mall_Customers dataset. The dataset comprises customer attributes such as Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income in dollars, and Spending Score (ranging from 1 to 100).
# Introduction ðŸ‘‹ :

By identifying distinct customer segments, the aim is to understand and target specific groups more effectively for marketing strategies or personalized services.
## Dataset :

The dataset used for this project is the Mall_Customers dataset, containing the following columns:

1) Customer ID
2) Gender
3) Age
4) Annual Income (in dollars)
5) Spending Score (1-100)
## Methodology :

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial exploration and understanding of the dataset, including statistical summaries, data visualizations, and identification of trends or patterns.
2) Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., Gender), and scaling numerical features if required.
3) Clustering Algorithm: Utilized K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their attributes, aiming to identify distinct segments within the customer base.
4) Visualization: Visualized clusters to comprehend the distribution of customers and their characteristics within each cluster.
5) Streamlit Integration: The program has been integrated into a Streamlit website for easy and interactive access.
## Tools Used :

1) Programming Language: Python.
2) IDE: Spyder.
3) Clustering Algorithm: K-means.
4) Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Sklearn.
5) Web Application Framework: Streamlit.
## Instructions to Run the Program :

1) Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2) Clone the repository or download the project files.
3) Install the necessary libraries by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
4) Open the Python program in Spyder or any preferred Python IDE.
5) Run the program to execute the customer segmentation using K-means clustering.
6) Access the Streamlit website generated by the program to explore the segmented customer data interactively.
## Files Included :

1) 'kmeans1.py' : Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, K-means clustering, and Streamlit integration.
2) 'Mall_Customers.csv' : The dataset used for customer segmentation.
3) 'README.md' : Documentation describing the project details, instructions and methodology.
4) 'Segment_model.pkl' : This is a model which I created using pipeline in jupyter notebook.
5) 'Customer Segment (kmeans).ipynb' : This is the file where I have written my code.
